# Known Issues

* Grid changes cannot be undone/redone from edit mode.

* The sky, and shaders that use World texture coordinates, will be re-oriented.

* Changing the grid origin will be flaky with multiple scenes.

* World-space constraints may not work, depending on how they're set up.

* Reparenting an object after a grid change may not work; use `Keep Transform`.
